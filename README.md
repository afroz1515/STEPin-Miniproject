# Sorting Techniques Using C language

## Description
The Sorting is an operation that segregates items into groups according to specified criterion,Sorting Books in Library (Dewey system) Sorting Individuals by Height (Feet and Inches) Sorting Movies in Blockbuster (Alphabetical) Sorting Numbers (Sequential) Most of the primary sorting algorithms run on different space and time complexity,Time Complexity is defined to be the time the computer takes to run a program (or algorithm in our case) Space complexity is defined to be the amount of memory the computer needs to run a program.There are many, many different types of sorting algorithms, but the primary ones are:'Bubble Sort','Selection Sort','Insertion Sort','Merge Sort''Quick Sort'.
